    "# The AIgent: Construction of inference models\n",
    "\n",
    "### The purpose of this notebook is to build regressors to predict genre tags from BERT embeddings of synopses. Data scraping, operation of the BERT language model, and detailed metric modeling are presented in other notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, several classifier models are explored. Each uses as its features a set of BERT embeddings; labels are genre tags. Note that these genre tags are user-generated (from Goodreads members). Because of this they have weights attached that can be used to set thresholds of class (ie genre) membership. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several classification strategies are common for text, including support vector machines, naive Bayes, and logistic regression. Each of these models is tested for accuracy and F1 scores across genres. Datasets are balanced prior to training for a particular genre tag, and only synopses with >1000 user tags are used in model building. In order to maintain the extensibility of the AIgent (ie to allow for new genre incorporation and to fine-tune genre classifiers), I have used a one-versus-all approach and have built an independent classifier for each genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all feature experimentation is included in this notebook. In other notebooks, I have tested the effect of synopsis length on classifier strength, seeking to set a balance between the speed of the model (which slows with longer synopses) and the robustness of the model (which slowly increases with longer synopses). \n",
    "\n",
    "### DATASETS:\n",

    "-Full df (with synopses, labels): full-ids-genretags-OHE-synopses-df-m9668-n20.csv\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Choice of metric is not fixed for this problem, and should be extended based on the application. As a first pass (ie to validate a model meant to surface similar titles and likely genre tags) I will use the one-versus all performance of classifiers. Because some genres share information (eg fantasy and sci-fi), and because incorrect genre assignment could have adverse effects on user engagement/trust, the most appropriate metric is Precision. Note that in subsequent versions of the AIgent, several updates could be made, including scoring precision across all genres; or precision for the top-1 or top-5 genres. \n",

    "### The best performance of the tested classifiers belongs to simple logistic regression models with default hyperparameter settings from Sklearn. While other models (eg SVM) in some cases achieve higher accuracy, those models do not generalize as well to test sets. Likely this is an indication of the robustness of the embeddings. \n",
